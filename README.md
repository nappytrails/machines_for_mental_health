__Project Name__  
Identifying candidates for mental health treatment using machine learning

__The Issue__  
Mental illness has a significant impact on the U.S. population and economy. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in five U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2020, but less than half (46.2%) received treatment. Additionally, serious mental illness causes $193.2 billion in lost earnings each year in the U.S.1 Early detection of mental illness could help prevent a serious condition from developing, increase treatment rates, and reduce lost earnings.


__Proposal__   
Develop a web application that uses machine learning to predict whether someone should seek mental health treatment.

__Data Source__   
_Mental Health in Tech Survey: Survey on Mental Health in the Tech Workplace in 2014_

__Machine learning strategy__   
Utilize supervised machine learning (classification) to predict who has sought treatment for a mental illness. Models to explore:   
+ Random forest
+ K nearest neighbor
Logistic regression
Support vector machine
